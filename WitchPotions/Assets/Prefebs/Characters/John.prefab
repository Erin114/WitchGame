    intro: Howdy Miss, been better
    genericConvo:
    - question: How do you feel?
      initialResponse: I've been feeling pretty worn out these days
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(This is a great starting point!  We know that he\u2019s been feeling
          tired lately, so maybe his problem lies in his vigilance.  Let\u2019s ask
          him an emotion specific question now.)"
      - character: 1
        text: "( These questions cost more patience since you\u2019re prying into
          their emotions, but they\u2019ll give you a good answer on if they\u2019re
          having trouble with this emotion or not.  Why don\u2019t you ask him if
          anything\u2019s been distracting him.) "
    - question: Has anything strange happened to you lately?
      initialResponse: Well my horse, Bessy, has fallen ill. Can't tell why, she
        was sturdy as an oak up until a few days ago...
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "Oh no!  Do you think she\u2019s going to be ok?"
      - character: 2
        text: "Ms. Bessy? Of course!  I\u2019d bet anything she\u2019ll be back on
          her hooves in no time."
    - question: Have you tried anything to fix your problem?
      initialResponse: Well I tried carrying the plow myself but I'm nowhere near
        as strong as Bessy
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: Do you have any other horses that can carry it?
      - character: 2
        text: "Nah, I don\u2019t need no other horses in my life, just Ms. Bessy. 
          She don\u2019t play well with others anyways.  Gets too jealous."
    - question: What problems are you dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: I've been working all day and night to try and tend to my
        fields but my horse is ill
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "You don\u2019t have anyone else to help you plow your fields?"
      - character: 2
        text: Nope.  Just me and Ms. Bessy.  My Pa has been too old to even carry
          a hoe for some time now.
    specificConvo:
    - question: Are you afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: Only thing John Johnson is afraid of is not being able to
        get these crops harvested before the winter comes, ya hear?

        text: "There ain\u2019t never been a thing I couldn\u2019t handle!"
      - character: 0
        text: Ok but what about a big spider.  Like, a REALLY big spider?
      - character: 2
        text: Nope.  Nothing.
      - character: 1
        text: "(Seems like he doesn\u2019t have any issues with fear so we can mark
          that down as a no.  Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any potions to help
          with delusions, a big spider WOULD be scary.)"
    - question: Are you feeling depressed?
      initialResponse: De-what? What in the devil does that mean?
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: You know, like really sad?
      - character: 2

          that down as a no.)"
    - question: Has something been distracting you?
      initialResponse: "I\u2019ve been so distracted with the field that I haven\u2019t
        been able to focus on anything else.  I just feel so tired lately.  I need
        a little something to get me going again."
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(I think you\u2019ve found the emotion at the root of his problems. 
          Great work Vivian!  Make sure to make a note of this in my pages.  Clicking
          once on an emotion will indicate that they are having problems with that
          emotion, checking twice will indicate that they aren\u2019t.)"
      - character: 1
        text: "(You can ask him more questions if you want, but I think we found
          our answer.  When you\u2019re done, take a look at the potions we can make
          and click on the Potion of Vitality and then head to the cauldron!)"
    - question: Are you avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: Miss, I don't have time to be 'voiding nothing!
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: Gee, I wish I could work as hard as you Mr. Johnson
      - character: 2
        text: "It\u2019s worn me down like a ton of bricks lil\u2019 miss."
      - character: 1
        text: "(Seems like he doesn\u2019t have any issues with loathing so we can
          mark that down as a no.  It sounds to me that he\u2019s pretty worn out. 
          Why don\u2019t you ask him if anything\u2019s been distracting him if you
          haven\u2019t already.)"
    - question: Have you had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: I ain't been angered since I knocked over my sister's stick
        and hoop as a kid. My daddy put the fear of god in me that day and I ain't
        done no such thing since!
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "Gee!  I suck at stick and hooping.  I\u2019d be so mad if someone
          knocked mine over."

      - character: 1
        text: "(Seems like he doesn\u2019t have any issues with joy so we can mark
          that down as a no.)"
    - question: Has anything surprised you?
      initialResponse: Well my one field of wheat grew taller than I expected! But
        besides that, not much...
