    intro: ...
    genericConvo:
    - question: How has she been feeling?
      initialResponse: "Well I\u2019m sure she\u2019s giddy as a schoolgirl now thanks
        to you.  Normally she\u2019s all mopey because she knows she\u2019ll get
        attention if she acts like a kicked puppy."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything strange happened to her lately?
      initialResponse: "If something did, you\u2019d know.  She wouldn\u2019t hesitate
        to shove it in your face how the world is out to get her."
      dialogue: []
    - question: What problems is she dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: "Oh where to begin!  It\u2019s something new she\u2019s crying
        over every day!  One minute she\u2019s whinging about the weather, the next
        it\u2019s because her daughters haven\u2019t written her back.  She\u2019s
        just insufferable.  I don\u2019t think she knows how to be happy!  Or maybe
        the attention she gets from being unhappy is what makes her happy, I don\u2019t
        know."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she tried anything to fix your problem?
      initialResponse: "To be quite honest with you I don\u2019t think she wants
        to.  She loves the attention it gets her from all the town\u2019s folk that
        pity her.  \u201CPoor Mabel!  Here let me help you with this!  Here let me
        coddle you!\u201D.  She\u2019s addicted to the attention I tell ya!"
      dialogue: []
    specificConvo:
    - question: Is she afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: "Not that I know of.  Even if I did, no one dares antagonize
        her for fear that she\u2019ll go squealing to the town's guard or to that
        brute of a husband of hers."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she felt sad at all?
      initialResponse: "Of course!  She\u2019s always complaining about something
        or other.  But it\u2019s like she enjoys it or it\u2019s all she knows how
        to be.  I swear, I would have no problems with her if I didn\u2019t have
        to hear about hers all the time."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has something been distracting her?
      initialResponse: "I don\u2019t think anything is able to keep her from being
        the pettiest trot in town.  The only thing she can keep her mind on is being
        the most miserable, sad sap in the room.  She loves the attention it gets
        her, it brings her so much joy I bet."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she been avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: "Hardly ever!  In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she
        seeks out misery if only to give her something new to complain about."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: "Nope.  Anytime you try to ignore her or she thinks she\u2019s
        been slighted, she just gets even more sad.  She must have been born without
        a spine!"
      dialogue: []
    - question: Is she happy?
      initialResponse: "In an odd way I think she is.  She feeds off the attention
        she gets from being sad.  She puts on a mopey face, but deep down, I think
        she\u2019s happier than anyone in this town.  For all her grumbling over
        her achy joints, I\u2019d be willing to bet a few pence that she\u2019s skipping
        on home right now.  If we could keep her from having anything to mope about
        later, I\u2019d say we\u2019re even."
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "That might be hard with the potion I just made for her\u2026  If you
          and your husband are arguing she\u2019ll probably complain tomorrow about
          you keeping her up all night\u2026"
      - character: 5
        text: "Can we give her anything to knock her out?  That way she won\u2019t
          get the satisfaction of seeing her plan work and she can\u2019t complain
          about me tomorrow!"
      - character: 0
        text: I can offer you a Sleep Potion.
      - character: 5
        text: "Perfect, I\u2019ll take it."
    - question: Has anything surprised her?
      initialResponse: "I doubt it, not until she realizes she\u2019s not the only
        one with tricks up her sleeve."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she felt appreciative of anything?
      initialResponse: "I\u2019m sure she feels appreciative of all the people that
        put up with all her bellyaching day in and day out!  I take that back, that
        would require her to think of anyone but herself for once! "
