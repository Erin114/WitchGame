    intro: ...
    genericConvo:
    - question: How has she been feeling?
      initialResponse: "Well I\u2019m sure she\u2019s giddy as a schoolgirl now thanks
        to you.  Normally she\u2019s all mopey because she knows she\u2019ll get
        attention if she acts like a kicked puppy."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything strange happened to her lately?
      initialResponse: "If something did, you\u2019d know.  She wouldn\u2019t hesitate
        to shove it in your face how the world is out to get her."
      dialogue: []
    - question: What problems is she dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: "Oh where to begin!  It\u2019s something new she\u2019s crying
        over every day!  One minute she\u2019s whinging about the weather, the next
        it\u2019s because her daughters haven\u2019t written her back.  She\u2019s
        just insufferable.  I don\u2019t think she knows how to be happy!"
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she tried anything to fix your problem?
      initialResponse: "To be quite honest with you I don\u2019t think she wants
        to.  She loves the attention it gets her from all the town\u2019s folk that
        pity her.  \u201CPoor Mabel, here let me help you with this\u201D.  She\u2019s
        addicted to the attention I tell ya!"
      dialogue: []
    specificConvo:
    - question: Is she afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: "Not that I know of.  Even if I did, no one dares touch her
        for fear that she\u2019ll go squealing to the town's guard or to that oaf
        of a husband of hers."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she felt sad at all?
      initialResponse: "Of course!  She\u2019s always complaining about something
        or other.  One night her husband fell asleep instead of taking her to go
        apple picking.  Me and some of the other women around town had bets on when
        her whining would end, it got to nearly a whole week!"
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: We do offer a Sleep Potion if you would be interested.
      - character: 5
        text: Perfect.
    - question: Has something been distracting her?
      initialResponse: "I don\u2019t think anything is able to keep her from being
        the pettiest blowse in town.  The only thing she can keep her mind on is
        being the most miserable sad sap in the room.  She loves the attention it
        gets her."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she been avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: "Hardly ever!  In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she
        seeks out misery if only to give her something new to complain about."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: "She probably throws a tantrum anytime she doesn\u2019t get
        the attention she\u2019s looking for, however, there is nothing on this Earth
        she could do to match the rage I feel for her now."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Is she happy?
      initialResponse: "For all her grumbling over her achy joints, I\u2019d be willing
        to bet a few pence that she\u2019s skipping on home now"
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything surprised her?
      initialResponse: "I doubt it, not until she realizes she\u2019s not the only
        one with tricks up her sleeve."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has she felt appreciative of anything?
      initialResponse: "I\u2019m sure she feels appreciative of all the people that
        put up with all her bellyaching day in and day out!"
