    emotion: this is irrelevant
    intro: Howdy Miss, been better
    genericConvo:
    - question: How do you feel?
      initialResponse: In my darkest hours, I feel not but a superior dread that
        I cannot vanquish on my own!  Mistress Vivian, please relieve me of the burden
        in which I carry!  The melancholy which plagues me has made off with my wisecracks
        like a thief in the night!  Oh, how my morale has been trampled upon by the
        cloven hooves of these New English animals!
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything strange happened to you lately?
      initialResponse: "Why, of course!  That\u2019s what brings me to this ramshackle
        establishment!  Tell me, the common folk here, have their ears never been
        graced by humor? These fools must be listless in their pursuit of happiness."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Have you tried anything to fix your problem?
      initialResponse: "I have worked laboriously over my comedy to evaluate the
        root of my dilemma, yet, I cannot produce material that sticks with this
        gloomy gathering of dunces!  Surely it cannot be me! (\u2026right?)"
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(Wait!  A crack in his confidence?  We might be onto something.  Ask
          him if anything\u2019s been distracting him.  He seems depressed, but this
          might lead us to a hidden root.)"
    - question: What problems are you dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: Everywhere I go, I am met with disdain.  The only amusement
        these bumpkins seem to know is that of mockery, at mine own expense!   Were
        we still in the confines of the glorious kingdom of England, I would not
        be treated with such animosity!
      dialogue: []
    specificConvo:
    - question: Are you afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: A man such as myself would never deign himself to the throws
        of fear!  Though I face adversity in this strange land, I shan't let it consume
        me!
      dialogue: []
    - question: Have you felt sad at all?
      initialResponse: An individual of the arts such as I is more than in touch
        with his emotions.  I can concede that I have felt the sting of salty tears
        on my skin in the shelter of my abode on occasion.

        text: "Wow, that is surprisingly\u2026 mature?"

        text: 'Of course, for I may be the most humble consciousness in existence. '
      - character: 0
        text: "Welp.  That didn\u2019t last long."
    - question: Has something been distracting you?
      initialResponse: "My jokes just do not land as they did while I was still in
        the good graces of the King.  My material hasn\u2019t changed, but the reaction
        has!  Have I lost my charm? No, it can\u2019t be!  Oh, what a predicament
        I find myself facing!"
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(I was right!  This imbecile just needs to believe in himself, when
          telling jokes, that is.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for us to
          inflate his ego much more.  Of course he won\u2019t admit that!  This is
          indubitably a hidden root.)"
      - character: 1
        text: '(Oh god, now he has me talking like an idiot too.  Quickly, mark down
          his issues with vigilance and joy in my pages so we can exile him from
          our store posthaste!) '
    - question: Are you avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: Everyone in this godforsaken land!  Not a single one with
        a funny bone in their body.  Why reduce myself to such a dour fate?
      dialogue: []
    - question: Have you had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: A gentleman, like myself, would never forfeit the dignity
        in which I have toiled so hard to earn over such miniscule matters as the
        ones I find myself embroiled in here.
      dialogue: []
    - question: Are you happy?
      initialResponse: "I must make an admission: I haven\u2019t been for some time. 
        I place the blame solely on my inhabitance!  I have exchanged castles for
        a glorified village and royalty for bleak peasantry.  Who among us would
        not feel the same were they placed in my shoes! "
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(Great, a public root!  At least we have something to go off of. 
          Let\u2019s keep looking for any hidden roots.  Why not ask him if anything
          is distracting him next?)"
    - question: Has anything surprised you?
      initialResponse: The only thing that has surprised me is the abomination you
        call food here in the colonies!  It is, without a doubt, the most vile thing
        to enter my figure.  Oh, were I still in England, I would not feel the pangs
        of famine that I do now!  This must be my divine punishment!
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: You fancy yourself a renaissance man then?
      - character: 3
        text: Who, me? Of course!  Could you not tell from my fine silks, or simply
          through the way in which words flow through mine own orifice?
      - character: 0
        text: "\u2026okay, no surprises here."
    - question: Have you felt appreciative of anything?
      initialResponse: I find solace in the fact that I retain my wit and charm despite
        the gloom in which I face in this wretched town.

      more of an innuendo, involving the Queen. '
