    intro: ...
    genericConvo:
    - question: How has he been feeling?
      initialResponse: "He seems pretty stressed from his job and all of Agnes\u2019
        nagging.  He\u2019s got to be scared of triggering her short temper."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything strange happened to him lately?
      initialResponse: "Not that I can recall from what he\u2019s told me.  His life
        seems rather boring. "
      dialogue: []
    - question: What problems is he dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: He constantly complains about how cruel Agnes can be.  She
        gets on him about not getting a promotion at work or how she should have
        married his more successful brother.  He hides it well, but I know it makes
        him sad.
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he tried anything to fix his problems?
      initialResponse: "He and Agnes fight constantly.  Well, it\u2019s more like
        Agnes yells at him and he takes it.  That\u2019s the way it is with her. 
        It\u2019s easier to just let her say what she wants than fight back.  He\u2019s
        probably afraid that if he argues with her, he\u2019ll only make it worse."
      dialogue: []
    specificConvo:
    - question: Is he afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: "You\u2019d think he would be terrified of her with everything
        she put him through, but deep down he still loves her.  He confided in me
        once that his true fear is that he\u2019ll disappoint Agnes.  It\u2019s probably
        what keeps him from fighting back."
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(That\u2019s definitely a charge!  Make sure to mark that down in
          my pages and maybe we can help this man gives Agnes a bit of what\u2019s
          coming to her)"
    - question: Has he felt sad at all?
      initialResponse: "Not any more than usual.  Only when Agnes\u2019 temper flares
        up, but he\u2019s quick to get over it.  I\u2019ve only ever seen him sad
        one time, and it\u2019s when he forgot to take Agnes to the horse races. 
        The whole town could hear her hollering at him for days!"
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "If you\u2019re still looking to make them fight, I could make something
          to make him forget about any upcoming dates they have coming up."
      - character: 4
        text: "Oh, what a splendid idea!  The only thing that would make it better
          is if he wasn\u2019t afraid to argue back with her.  Oh that would be a
          fight for the ages!"
    - question: Has something been distracting him?
      initialResponse: "At this point I doubt he\u2019s ever surprised by her temper. 
        He seems to expect it every night when he goes home.  It might be more of
        a surprise to him if she doesn\u2019t start nagging the second he walks in
        the door."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he been avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: Well, he still goes home to her every night, so, I doubt it.
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: "No, but he needs to for my plan to work!  God bless him,
        I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be terrified of her after this, but I\u2019d love
        for Agnes to get a taste of her own medicine."
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "If you don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else we can make to
          help, we can make him a potion of rage."
      - character: 4
        text: That sounds perfect!  What an intelligent young lady you are.  You
          know, you remind me of a younger me!
      - character: 1
        text: "(Better hope you don\u2019t turn out like her.  Squabbling with petty
          old women.)"
    - question: Is he happy?
      initialResponse: "He seems like he is.  Well, as happy as he can be in his
        situation.  He probably won\u2019t be for a bit after I slip him whatever
        we make for him, but at least I will be!"
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything surprised him?
      initialResponse: "I wouldn\u2019t say so.  He lives a rather mundane life. 
        He heads down the road in the morning to his shop and comes home in the evening
        to get pestered by Agnes."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he felt appreciative of anything?
      initialResponse: He tries to keep a positive outlook on life.  His job is boring
        but it gets him by.  And despite it all he still loves Agnes

      she says to me. Some nights, I cry myself to sleep when I remember!  I\u2019ve
      tried to stay away from her, but she lives right next to me, and I have no

      put me through!  Her husband is a friendly guy, he always stops by my house
      on his way home from work to say hello while I\u2019m tending to my garden. 
      I\u2019m thinking of slipping him something that will make him mad enough to
      start an argument with her.  That\u2019ll annoy her to no end and I\u2019ll
      be able to listen in from next door.   "
