    intro: ...
    genericConvo:
    - question: How has he been feeling?
      initialResponse: "He seems pretty stressed from his job and all of Agnes\u2019
        nagging.  He\u2019s got to be scared of triggering her short temper."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has anything strange happened to him lately?
      initialResponse: "Not that I can recall from what he\u2019s told me.  His life
        seems rather boring."
      dialogue: []
    - question: What problems is he dealing with right now?
      initialResponse: "He constantly complains about how cruel Agnes can be.  She
        gets on him about not getting a promotion at work or how she should have
        married his more successful brother.  He always takes the long way back home
        after work because he\u2019s scared that he\u2019ll get yelled at first thing
        when he walks in the door."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he tried anything to fix his problems?
      initialResponse: "He and Agnes fight constantly.  Well, it\u2019s more like
        Agnes yells at him and he takes it.  That\u2019s the way it is with her. 
        It\u2019s easier to just let her say what she wants than fight back.  He\u2019s
        probably scared that if he argues with her, he\u2019ll only make it worse."
      dialogue: []
    specificConvo:
    - question: Is he afraid of anything?
      initialResponse: "If I had to guess, he\u2019s afraid of disappointing Agnes. 
        He puts up with a lot, but deep down he still loves her.  One time, he forgot
        he had promised to take her to see the horse races and the whole town could
        hear her hollering at him for days. "
      dialogue:
      - character: 0
        text: "If you\u2019re still looking to make them fight, I could make something
          to make him forget about any upcoming dates they have coming up."
      - character: 1
        text: "Oh, that\u2019s a splendid idea!"
    - question: Has he felt sad at all?
      initialResponse: "Not any more than usual.  Only when Agnes\u2019 temper flares
        up, but he\u2019s quick to get over it."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has something been distracting him?
      initialResponse: "At this point I doubt he\u2019s ever surprised by her temper. 
        He seems to expect it every night when he goes home.  It might be more of
        a surprise to him if she doesn\u2019t start nagging the second he walks in
        the door."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he been avoiding anything?
      initialResponse: Well, he still goes home to her every night, so, I doubt it.
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he had any outbursts of anger recently?
      initialResponse: "No, but he needs to for my plan to work!  God bless him,
        but I\u2019d love for Agnes to get a taste of her own medicine."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Is he happy?
      initialResponse: "He seems like he is.  Well, as happy as he can be in his
        situation.  He probably won\u2019t be for a bit after I slip him whatever
        we make for him, but at least I will be!"
      dialogue:
      - character: 1
        text: "(This woman is ecstatic!  I\u2019ve never seen someone this happy
          to stir the pot before.  I would definitely mark her down for having an
          emotional charge in Joy)."
      - character: 1
        text: "(This woman is ecstatic!  I\u2019ve never seen someone this happy
          to stir the pot before.  I would definitely mark her down for having an
          emotional charge in Joy)."
    - question: Has anything surprised him?
      initialResponse: "I wouldn\u2019t say so.  He lives a rather mundane life. 
        He heads down the road in the morning to his shop and comes home in the evening
        to get pestered by Agnes."
      dialogue: []
    - question: Has he felt appreciative of anything?
      initialResponse: He tries to keep a positive outlook on life.  His job is boring
        but it gets him by.  And despite it all he still loves Agnes

    text: "Great job handling that guy, you\u2019ve really got the hang of this! 
      It helps when you learn from the best, huh?  There\u2019s only one more thing
      that I have left to teach you about for now and that\u2019s charges.  Emotional
      charges are emotions that the individual is feeling separate from the potion
      that they may need."
  - character: 1
    text: " In order to brew the perfect potion, we need to address these.  It\u2019ll
      better help the customer and it usually makes them tip better.  Whenever you
      think you\u2019ve discovered a charge, mark it down in my pages.  Click once
      if you think you\u2019ve found one, and click twice if you think that emotion
      isn\u2019t related to a charge.  Seems like someone\u2019s here, let's try
      to identify any charges they might have."

    text: "Why good afternoon, deary.  I saw that you\u2019ve just opened up shop,
      is this a pharmacy of some kind?"
  - character: 0
    text: Of course!  We sell all kinds of remedies for anything you need.
  - character: 4
    text: "How splendid!  This place seems like a fine establishment, not like those
      decrepit witch breweries.  Them and their black magic are a plague upon this
      town.  I\u2019ve not met a single witch that I couldn\u2019t tell just from
      looking at her.  If you ever see one, go to the town\u2019s inquisitors, I\u2019ve
      reported four \u2013 no - five myself!"
  - character: 0
    text: "You\u2019ve got nothing to worry about, no witches here haha\u2026 Anyways,
      what can I help you out with?"
  - character: 4
    text: "I desperately need your help!  There\u2019s this other lady in town, Agnes,
      and she's nothing but a bully I say!  You don\u2019t want to know the things
      she says to me. Some nights, I cry myself to sleep when I remember!  I\u2019ve
      tried to stay away from her but she lives right next to me and I have no one
      else to talk to during the day while my husband is at work.  Just this once,
      I want to get revenge for all the suffering she\u2019s put me through!"
  - character: 4
    text: "Her husband is a friendly guy, he always stops by my house on his way
      home from work to say hello while I\u2019m tending to my garden.  I\u2019m
      thinking of giving him something that will make him mad enough to start an
      argument.  That\u2019ll annoy her to no end and I\u2019ll be able to listen
      in from next door."
  - character: 0
    text: "Wow she sounds just awful!  Let me ask you some questions about her husband,
      I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something we can come up with to help you out."
  - character: 1
    text: "(This woman is awfully giddy at the thought of antagonizing her \u201Cfriend\u201D. 
      Weird.  It might be worth asking her about joy to see if there are any charges
      there)"
